                <p>Hi, I'm Pearl, a Junior Front-End Developer and Certified Software Tester. After months of job searching with no clear plan, I found myself overwhelmed—losing track of applications, forgetting follow-ups, and struggling to stay organized. I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
                <p>That's when I decided to build Job Tracker—a simple yet powerful tool to help job seekers keep everything in one place. With this extension, I can log job applications, update statuses, and track progress with ease. My goal? To finally check off some of those applications as <strong>"Hired!"</strong> and help others do the same.</p>
                <p>I hope this tool makes your job search more structured, less stressful, and ultimately, more successful.</p>
                <p>Happy job hunting!</p>
