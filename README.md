# Job Tracker Chrome Extension

## Overview
Job Tracker is a Chrome extension designed to help users efficiently track job applications. It allows users to save job postings, organize application statuses, and manage their job search process seamlessly.

## Features
- **Save Job Listings**: Quickly add job postings from different websites.
- **Track Application Status**: Update the status of each application (e.g., Applied, Interview Scheduled, Offer Received, Rejected).
- **Organize by Categories**: Filter jobs based on status or company.
- **Notes Section**: Add custom notes for each application.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design.

## Behaviour
The popup in this Chrome extension can be resized manually by dragging the edges of the window. However, please note that the content inside the popup will remain the same size, and it will not scale or expand to fit the resized window. This design is intentional to ensure the consistency and compact nature of the popup interface.
